Shared Dependencies:

1. **Hardware Components:** All files will need to interact with the hardware components such as the Raspberry Pi, DC motors, ultrasonic sensors, imu, GPS module, Raspberry Pi cam, NRF radios, telemetry radio, servos, and gripper. The specific hardware component used will depend on the functionality of the file.

2. **Libraries:** Libraries such as RPi.GPIO (for controlling Raspberry Pi GPIO channels), OpenCV (for object recognition), TensorFlow (for machine learning models), pySerial (for serial communication), and others might be used across multiple files.

3. **Data Schemas:** Sensor data (from ultrasonic sensors, imu, GPS module), image data (from Raspberry Pi cam), motor control data, and communication data (from NRF radios and telemetry radio) will be shared across multiple files.

4. **Function Names:** Functions for controlling the motors (e.g., `drive_forward`, `drive_backward`, `turn_left`, `turn_right`), reading sensor data (e.g., `read_ultrasonic`, `read_imu`, `read_gps`), recognizing objects (e.g., `recognize_object`), controlling the servos and gripper (e.g., `move_servo`, `open_gripper`, `close_gripper`), and handling wireless communication (e.g., `send_data`, `receive_data`) will be used in multiple files.

5. **Variables:** Variables such as `motor_speed`, `obstacle_distance`, `object_location`, `gps_coordinates`, `imu_orientation`, and `communication_message` will be shared across multiple files.

6. **Constants:** Constants such as the GPIO pin numbers, motor specifications, sensor specifications, and communication parameters will be shared across multiple files.

7. **Error Messages:** Standardized error messages for hardware failures, sensor reading errors, communication errors, and other exceptions might be used across multiple files.

8. **Testing Parameters:** Parameters for testing the robot's functionalities such as the test environment, test objects, and test scenarios will be shared across the `testing.py` and `optimization.py` files.
